Potential places to parallelize in khmer code:

* ktable.consume(sequence)

It appears that consume( ) sequencially splits a read into k-mers.  We could parallelize this either by:
1) Splitting up reads, and distributing to individual multi-processors
2) Giving multiple reads to individual multi-processors, and letting a stream processor work on its own read
